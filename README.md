# Ecommerce Marketplace Platform

Welcome to the **Ecommerce Marketplace Platform** repository! This project is a fully functional online marketplace where users can buy, sell, and post products. Inspired by platforms like **HYPD** in India and global marketplaces such as **Etsy**, **Depop**, and **Poshmark**, this platform provides a seamless experience for both buyers and sellers. Built with **Go (Golang)** and the **Goa Framework**, it is scalable, efficient, and easy to deploy.

## Features

- **User Roles**:
  - **Buyers**: Browse products, add to cart, and place orders.
  - **Sellers**: Post products, manage listings, and track sales.
- **Product Listings**: Sellers can create, update, and delete product listings with details like price, description, and images.
- **Search and Filters**: Buyers can search for products and filter by category, price range, and more.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, remove, and update items in the cart.
- **Order Management**: Track orders, view order history, and manage deliveries.
- **User Profiles**: Personalized profiles for buyers and sellers.
- **Authentication**: Secure login and registration using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.
- **Database**: Robust data storage with **PostgreSQL**.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage users, products, and orders (admin-only).

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Go (Golang)
- **Framework**: Goa Framework (DSL-based API design)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **API Design**: Goa DSL for clean and scalable API definitions
- **Deployment**: Docker, or any cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- Go (v1.20 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (local or cloud instance)
- Goa Framework (install via `go install goa.design/goa/v3/cmd/goa@v3`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prth1234/Ecommerce.git
   cd Ecommerce
   ```

2. **Set up the database**:
   - Create a PostgreSQL database and update the connection string in the configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml` or `.env`).
   - Example connection string:
     ```env
     DB_HOST=localhost
     DB_PORT=5432
     DB_USER=your_db_user
     DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
     DB_NAME=your_db_name
     ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

4. **Build and run the application**:
   - Navigate to the `cmd/store` directory:
     ```bash
     cd cmd/store
     ```
   - Build the application:
     ```bash
     go build
     ```
   - Run the application:
     ```bash
     ./store
     ```
Shortcut : Once go module are downloaded, just run 
  ```bash
lsof -t -i :8000 | xargs -r kill -9 && go build && ./store 
  ```
5. **Access the application**:
   - The API server will start running at `http://localhost:8080`.
   - Use tools like **Postman** or **cURL** to interact with the API endpoints.
